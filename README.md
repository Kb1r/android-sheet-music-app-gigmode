# Digital Sheet Music Management System

🎵 **Native Android application for digital sheet music management**

Developed as my final year dissertation project for BSc Computer Science at the University of Chester (2025-2026).

## 📱 Overview

This app was designed to explore solutions for musicians transitioning from physical to digital sheet music. The project demonstrates full-stack Android development, database design, and software engineering principles applied to a real-world problem.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Digital Library Management** - Database architecture supporting 200+ music entries
- **Custom Categorization** - Tag system for composer, genre, difficulty, instrument
- **Advanced Search** - Multi-parameter search with custom SQLite queries
- **Offline Access** - Local storage with no internet dependency
- **Material Design UI** - Modern Android interface following Google's design guidelines

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Platform:** Android SDK (API Level 24+)
- **Database:** SQLite with custom data models
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub
- **IDE:** Android Studio

## 📊 Development Process

- Researched existing music management solutions and identified gaps
- Designed relational database schema for music organization
- Implemented custom sorting and filtering algorithms
- Followed Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology
- Applied object-oriented programming principles throughout

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to:
- Apply theoretical CS knowledge to practical application development
- Design and implement complex database relationships
- Handle file I/O and local storage on Android
- Create user-friendly interfaces with Material Design
- Manage a long-term software project independently
